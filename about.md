Hello!

I'm a developer living in the Tampa, Florida area.  I graduated from the University of Florida (Go Gators!) with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, but I've always had a passion for computers and now I find myself working as an IT consultant.  I have a wife and two small children, and between them and work I sometimes find the time to write about things I find interesting in the coding realm.
