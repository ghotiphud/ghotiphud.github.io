Factoring
---------------

First a definition (made up as I type right now, seems legit):

`Representing something as a composite of it's parts.`

If we all think back to our days in school, there's a good chance that you've covered this topic in algebra. Most likely as a way to find the roots of an equation.  For example:

```
f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3

f(x) = (x + 3) * (x - 1)

so for f(x) = 0, 
x = -3 or 1
```

Now, how does this apply in coding you might ask?  What are the "roots" of our software equation?  Just as our equation became easier to understand, and easier to work with, so will our code when properly factored.  Unfortunately for us, there are often no simple variables to be found in our code, so where do we even start?
