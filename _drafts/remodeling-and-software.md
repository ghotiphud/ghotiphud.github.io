    * Technique

* Troubles During Remodel
    * Splotchy Stain
        * Endcaps made of melamine
        * Lack of Experience
        * Jumping in too quickly
        * Discounting the technique
    * Saw dust Coffee

* Good things
    * Idea to implementation gap (Momentum)
    * Mostly working kitchen the whole time (Cleanup along the way)
    * Work scheduled ahead of time with dependencies
    * 

# Applied to Software

* Troubles
    * Experimental Spikes - Figure out what you're doing before jumping right in
    * Software Development Technique (TDD, Architecture, etc.)
    * Small Batches - Scrum, Sprints
    * Model dependencies - Gantt?

* Good things
    * Good idea? Get to work!
    * Keep your software working (Refactor existing, don't rewrite all at once)
    * Take time to break down and schedule work
    *
